This is a little learning project to learn html, css, and javscript.
The big 'Make An Appointment' button leads to a drop down animation done in JS(but could be done in css anyway).
The form that drops down will turn each form into cookies when you submit.
The next time you try to book an appointment, it will remember your inputs in the form of
placeholder values.

I completely separated html, css, and javascript "elements" for the sake of learning.

# Cookies
The firstName, lastName, and telephone number entered into the form when you press submit will be saved as a cookie.
Reset the cookies with the clearCookies() function in the terminal in Dev Tools.
